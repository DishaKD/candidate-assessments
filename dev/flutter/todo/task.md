# Description

- Build a simple todo application which uses any form of persistant data storage.
- Build an APK or IPA, upload it somewhere and include the link to it in the pull request.
- Include both a light and dark theme in the application. This configuration must be persistant as well. `(The theme shouldn't reset on login)`
