# Description

- Take into consideration the email which you will have received informing you of this task. It's a normal text email. Your task is to convert this into an HTML email with an appropriate design which retains the same content. There should be a button which on click, directs a user to this exact repository we're in.

- You need to implement a node server with an endpoint which can be fed with a list of names and emails and the above designed template email should be sent to all of them.

- Further there should be a record maintained of the emails sent out and there should be a mechanism to track if a user clicked on the button which redirects to this repo. `(There should be another endpoint which retrieves a list of sent emails and information whether the user clicked on the button or not)`

- You are free to use any email client.
