# Selection Criteria

## Dev

- The written code should function properly.

- The code should adhere to code quality standards. For more information on few of these standards, please refer to https://javascript.info/code-quality. `(Some of these will not be applicable to tasks which require other tech stacks apart from Javascript but the ones that do will be assessed)` 

- Apart from the above, proper directory structure, documentation `(For example instructions on how to get the project up and running)`, and reasonable separation between logical components will be required.

- Code can be referenced from anywhere. This repository is public which means you can even refer to other submissions. However, whatever code you may use will have to have the ability to be explained in the following interview if you are selected. Failure to do so will result in us considering that it's just a mere copy paste of code. 

## Design

- You can use any logos you want.
